# MediTrack - Medication Tracker # version 1

## Overview
MediTrack is a simple web-based application designed to help users manage their medications efficiently. It allows users to keep track of their medicines, set up reminders for doses, and receive alerts when it's time for a refill.

## Features
- **Home Page:** Provides an overview of the application and its functionality.
- **Medications:** Lists the user's medications, including dosage, supply status, and last taken time.
- **Refill Alerts:** Displays alerts for medications that are running low and need refills.
- **Reminders:** Shows daily medication reminders to ensure users take their medicine on time.
- **Navigation Bar:** Enables seamless switching between different sections of the app.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the application.
- **CSS**: For styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For handling page navigation and interactivity.

## Installation
No installation is required. Simply open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser to use MediTrack.

## Usage
1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. Navigate through the sections using the top menu:
   - "Home" to get an introduction to the app.
   - "Medications" to see your listed medicines and their details.
   - "Refill Alerts" to check when you need to restock medications.
   - "Reminders" to view your scheduled medication times.
3. Click on a section to display its content dynamically.

## How It Works
- The application uses JavaScript to dynamically show and hide different sections based on user interaction.
- The `showPage(pageId)` function is responsible for displaying the selected section while hiding others.
- A simple UI ensures an intuitive user experience, making it easy to navigate.

## Future Enhancements
